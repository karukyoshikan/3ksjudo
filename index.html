                    <h3>Our Values</h3>
                    <p>Judo practitioners should honour the legacy of past martial arts by preserving their wisdom and values. The samurai spirit—embodying courage, discipline, and honour—remains vital today, fostering character and ethical behaviour. These timeless principles enrich modern society and should be passed on to future generations.</p>

            <p>Japanese Judo Team trained at the club in preparation for the 1999 World Championships in Birmingham, UK. No visits of this training was allowed whilst they were training, but the club was gifted this photo. Jack Webb remembers when they first visited, and 5/6 white touring 50-seater coaches arrived, and a few lucky people got to meet Professor Jigoro Kano's grandson, the founder of the sport of Judo.</p>

                        <h3>The Journey of Progress in Judo</h3>
                        <p><strong>Hey there!</strong> If you’re diving into the world of Judo, you’ve probably come across the term “Mon Grades.” These are an integral part of the journey for young judokas, marking their progress and achievements as they grow in the art. Let’s explore what Mon Grades are all about and why they matter.</p>
                        <h4>What Are Mon Grades?</h4>
                        <p>Mon Grades are a grading system specifically designed for junior judokas, typically under the age of 16. Unlike the traditional Kyu and Dan grades used for adults, Mon Grades provide a structured and motivational pathway for children to progress in Judo. These grades recognize the developing skills and dedication of young practitioners, encouraging them to continue their training and improvement.</p>
                        <h4>The Structure of Mon Grades</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li><span>White Belt (10th Mon):</span> The starting point for all beginners. This grade is about getting familiar with the basics of Judo, learning proper etiquette, and understanding the dojo environment.</li>
                            <li><span>Yellow Belt (9th and 8th Mon):</span> Here, students start to learn more techniques and improve their coordination and control. It’s a crucial stage for building a strong foundation.</li>
                            <li><span>Orange Belt (7th and 6th Mon):</span> At this level, judokas begin to refine their techniques and introduce more advanced throws and holds. It’s about combining skill with strategy.</li>
                            <li><span>Green Belt (5th and 4th Mon):</span> Students now focus on perfecting their techniques, increasing their physical conditioning, and understanding more complex concepts of Judo.</li>
                            <li><span>Blue Belt (3rd and 2nd Mon):</span> This stage emphasizes advanced techniques and greater precision. Judokas at this level are preparing for the transition to senior grades.</li>
                            <li><span>Brown Belt (1st Mon):</span> The highest Mon grade, where young judokas demonstrate a comprehensive understanding of Judo. They show proficiency in various techniques and a deep respect for the art.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h4>The Importance of Mon Grades</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li><span>Motivation and Recognition:</span> For young judokas, earning a new belt or stripe is a significant achievement. It provides tangible evidence of their hard work and progress, keeping them motivated to continue training.</li>

                        <h3>The Path to Mastery in Judo</h3>
                        <p><strong>Hey there!</strong> So, you're curious about Kyu Grades in Judo. These are a significant part of a judoka's journey, marking the progression from beginner to advanced practitioner before moving on to the Dan grades. Let's dive into what Kyu Grades are, their structure, and why they matter.</p>
                        <h4>What Are Kyu Grades?</h4>
                        <p>Kyu Grades are the ranking system for judokas who are 16 years and older. They represent the progression from beginner to advanced levels before reaching the black belt ranks, known as Dan grades. Each Kyu grade requires the judoka to demonstrate increasing levels of skill, knowledge, and understanding of Judo techniques and principles.</p>
                        <h4>The Structure of Kyu Grades</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li><span>6th Kyu (Rokkyu) – White Belt:</span> This is where all beginners start. At this level, judokas learn the basic etiquette, fundamental movements, and the most basic throws and holds.</li>
                            <li><span>5th Kyu (Gokyu) – Yellow Belt:</span> At this stage, judokas start to build on their foundational skills, learning more techniques and improving their coordination and balance.</li>
                            <li><span>4th Kyu (Yonkyu) – Orange Belt:</span> Judokas at this level begin to refine their techniques, incorporating more advanced throws and holds and starting to understand the principles of leverage and balance.</li>
                            <li><span>3rd Kyu (Sankyu) – Green Belt:</span> This grade represents a significant advancement in skill. Judokas improve their technical execution and start to develop a deeper strategic understanding of Judo.</li>
                            <li><span>2nd Kyu (Nikyu) – Blue Belt:</span> At this level, judokas work on perfecting their techniques and improving their physical conditioning. They also begin to learn more complex techniques and combinations.</li>
                            <li><span>1st Kyu (Ikkyu) – Brown Belt:</span> The highest Kyu grade, where judokas demonstrate a comprehensive understanding of Judo techniques and principles. This grade is often seen as a preparatory stage before attempting to achieve the first Dan (black belt).</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h4>The Importance of Kyu Grades</h4>
                        <ul>

                            <li><span>Motivation and Goal Setting:</span> Earning each new grade serves as a milestone that recognizes the judoka's hard work and progress. This keeps them motivated and focused on their training.</li>
                            <li><span>Skill Mastery:</span> The Kyu system ensures that judokas master fundamental techniques before moving on to more advanced ones. This foundational mastery is crucial for long-term success in Judo.</li>
                            <li><span>Confidence Building:</span> Progressing through the Kyu grades helps build confidence in a judoka's abilities. This increased self-assurance can positively impact other areas of their life.</li>
                            <li><span>Discipline and Perseverance:</span> The journey through the Kyu grades requires discipline, dedication, and perseverance, qualities that are valuable both on and off the mat.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h4>The Grading Process</h4>
                        <p>Grading for Kyu ranks usually involves a formal examination where the judoka demonstrates the required techniques, knowledge, and sometimes randori (sparring) skills. These exams are conducted by qualified instructors who assess the judoka's proficiency and readiness to advance to the next grade.</p>
                        <h4>Conclusion</h4>

                        <h4>The Importance of Dan Grades</h4>

                        <h4>The Grading Process</h4>
                        <p>Advancing through Dan grades involves rigorous examinations and evaluations by high-ranking judokas.
